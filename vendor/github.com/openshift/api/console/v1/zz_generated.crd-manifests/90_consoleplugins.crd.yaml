                  contentSecurityPolicy is a list of Content-Security-Policy (CSP) directives for the plugin.
                  Each directive specifies a list of values, appropriate for the given directive type,
                  for example a list of remote endpoints for fetch directives such as ScriptSrc.
                  Console web application uses CSP to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks,
                  such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.
                  Dynamic plugins should specify this field if need to load assets from outside
                  the cluster or if violation reports are observed. Dynamic plugins should always prefer
                  loading their assets from within the cluster, either by vendoring them, or fetching
                  from a cluster service.
                  CSP violation reports can be viewed in the browser's console logs during development and
                  testing of the plugin in the OpenShift web console.
                  Available directive types are DefaultSrc, ScriptSrc, StyleSrc, ImgSrc, FontSrc and ConnectSrc.
                  Each of the available directives may be defined only once in the list.
                  The value 'self' is automatically included in all fetch directives by the OpenShift web
                  console's backend.
                  For more information about the CSP directives, see:
                  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy

                  The OpenShift web console server aggregates the CSP directives and values across
                  its own default values and all enabled ConsolePlugin CRs, merging them into a single
                  policy string that is sent to the browser via `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP response header.

                  Example:
                    ConsolePlugin A directives:
                      script-src: https://script1.com/, https://script2.com/
                      font-src: https://font1.com/

                    ConsolePlugin B directives:
                      script-src: https://script2.com/, https://script3.com/
                      font-src: https://font2.com/
                      img-src: https://img1.com/

                    Unified set of CSP directives, passed to the OpenShift web console server:
                      script-src: https://script1.com/, https://script2.com/, https://script3.com/
                      font-src: https://font1.com/, https://font2.com/
                      img-src: https://img1.com/

                            service is an in-cluster Service that the plugin will connect to.
                            The Service must use HTTPS. The console backend exposes an endpoint
                            in order to proxy communication between the plugin and the Service.
                            Note: service field is required for now, since currently only "Service"
                            type is supported.
