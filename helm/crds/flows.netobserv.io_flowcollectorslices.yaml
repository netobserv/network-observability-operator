                    `subnetLabels` allows to customize subnets and IPs labelling, such as to identify cluster-external workloads or web services.
                    Beware that the subnet labels configured in FlowCollectorSlice are not limited to the flows of the related namespace: any flow
                    in the whole cluster can be labelled using this configuration. However, subnet labels defined in the cluster-scoped FlowCollector take
                    precedence in case of conflicting rules.
