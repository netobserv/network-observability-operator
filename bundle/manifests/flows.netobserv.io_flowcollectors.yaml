                      The Console plugin can use either Loki or Prometheus as a data source for metrics (see also `spec.prometheus.querier`), or both.
                      Not all queries are transposable from Loki to Prometheus. Hence, if Loki is disabled, some features of the plugin are disabled as well,
                      such as getting per-pod information or viewing raw flows.
                      If both Prometheus and Loki are enabled, Prometheus takes precedence and Loki is used as a fallback for queries that Prometheus cannot handle.
                      If they are both disabled, the Console plugin is not deployed.

                                      a node that violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is

                                      node(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred.

                          `includeList` is a list of metric names to specify which ones to generate.
                          The names correspond to the names in Prometheus without the prefix. For example,
                          `namespace_egress_packets_total` shows up as `netobserv_namespace_egress_packets_total` in Prometheus.
                          Note that the more metrics you add, the bigger is the impact on Prometheus workload resources.
                          Metrics enabled by default are:
                          `namespace_flows_total`, `node_ingress_bytes_total`, `node_egress_bytes_total`, `workload_ingress_bytes_total`,
                          `workload_egress_bytes_total`, `namespace_drop_packets_total` (when `PacketDrop` feature is enabled),
                          `namespace_rtt_seconds` (when `FlowRTT` feature is enabled), `namespace_dns_latency_seconds` (when `DNSTracking` feature is enabled),

                          When `enable` is `true`, the Console plugin queries flow metrics from Prometheus instead of Loki whenever possible.

                          The Console plugin can use either Loki or Prometheus as a data source for metrics (see also `spec.loki`), or both.
                          Not all queries are transposable from Loki to Prometheus. Hence, if Loki is disabled, some features of the plugin are disabled as well,
                          such as getting per-pod information or viewing raw flows.
                          If both Prometheus and Loki are enabled, Prometheus takes precedence and Loki is used as a fallback for queries that Prometheus cannot handle.
                          If they are both disabled, the Console plugin is not deployed.
