Description::
+
--
FlowCollectorSlice is the API allowing to decentralize some of the FlowCollector configuration per namespace tenant.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and might reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers might infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| `object`
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| FlowCollectorSliceSpec defines the desired state of FlowCollectorSlice

| Property | Type | Description

| `sampling`
| `integer`
| `sampling` is an optional sampling interval to apply to this slice. For example, a value of `50` means that 1 matching flow in 50 is sampled.

| `subnetLabels`
| `array`
| `subnetLabels` allows you to customize subnets and IPs labeling, such as to identify cluster external workloads or web services.
External subnets must be labeled with the prefix `EXT:`, or not labeled at all, in order to work with default quick filters and some metrics examples provided. +

Beware that the subnet labels configured in FlowCollectorSlice are not limited to the flows of the related namespace: any flow
in the whole cluster can be labeled using this configuration. However, subnet labels defined in the cluster-scoped FlowCollector take
precedence in case of conflicting rules.

| Property | Type | Description

| `cidrs`
| `array (string)`
| List of CIDRs, such as `["1.2.3.4/32"]`.

| `name`
| `string`
| Label name, used to flag matching flows.
External subnets must be labeled with the prefix `EXT:`, or not labeled at all, in order to work with default quick filters and some metrics examples provided. +
