[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/netobserv/network-observability-operator)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/netobserv/network-observability-operator)

NetObserv Operator is a Kubernetes / OpenShift operator for network observability. It deploys a monitoring pipeline that consists in:
- an eBPF agent, that generates network flows from captured packets
- flowlogs-pipeline, a component that collects, enriches and exports these flows
- when used in OpenShift, a Console plugin for flows visualization with powerful filtering options, a topology representation and more

Flow data is then available in multiple ways, each optional:

- As Prometheus metrics
- As raw flow logs stored in Loki
- As raw flow logs exported to a collector

## Getting Started

You can install the NetObserv Operator using [Helm](https://helm.sh/), or directly from sources.

In OpenShift, NetObserv is named Network Observability operator and can be found in OperatorHub as an OLM operator. This section does not apply to it: please refer to the [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/observability/network_observability/installing-operators.html) in that case.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NetObserv community was previously distributed via [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/operator/netobserv-operator). This installation method is replaced with a helm chart. If you previously installed NetObserv community from OperatorHub, we recommend that you uninstall it, and re-install using the helm chart. The operation should not cause any data loss.

### Pre-requisite

NetObserv has a couple of dependencies that must be installed on your cluster:

- Cert-manager
- Prometheus
- Loki

Loki is not mandatory but improves the overall experience with NetObserv.
If you don't have these dependencies already, some convenience scripts are available from the repository, provided for demo purpose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/netobserv/network-observability-operator.git && cd network-observability-operator
PORT_FWD=false make deploy-prometheus deploy-loki install-cert-manager
# (it is expected to see errors while running this script, since it runs several attempts creating a certificate for testing, before eventually succeeding)
```

### Install with Helm

Check it out on [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/netobserv/netobserv-operator).

```bash
helm repo add netobserv https://netobserv.io/static/helm/ || helm repo update
helm install my-netobserv --set standaloneConsole.enable=true netobserv/netobserv-operator
# If you're in OpenShift, you can omit "--set standaloneConsole.enable=true" to use the Console plugin instead.
```

You can now create a `FlowCollector` resource. Refer to the [Configuration section](#configuration) of this document. A very short `FlowCollector` should work, using default values, plus with the standalone console enabled:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1beta2
kind: FlowCollector
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  namespace: netobserv
  consolePlugin:
    advanced:
      env:
        TEST_CONSOLE: "true"
  prometheus:
    querier:
      manual:
        url: http://prometheus:9090
EOF
```

A few remarks:
- While the [web console](https://github.com/netobserv/network-observability-console-plugin) is primarily designed as a plugin for the OpenShift Console, it is still possible to deploy it as a standalone, which the dev team sometimes use for testing. This is why it is mentioned as "TEST_CONSOLE" here.
- If you're in OpenShift, you should omit "TEST_CONSOLE: true" to use the Console plugin instead, which offers a better / more integrated experience.
- You can change the Prometheus URL depending on your installation. This example URL works if you use the `make deploy-prometheus` script from the repository. Prometheus configuration options are documented [here](./docs/FlowCollector.md#flowcollectorspecprometheus-1).

To view the test console, you can port-forward 9001:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/netobserv-plugin 9001:9001 -n netobserv
```

Then open http://localhost:9001/ in your browser.

### Install from repository

A couple of `make` targets are provided in this repository to allow installing without OLM:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/netobserv/network-observability-operator.git && cd network-observability-operator
USER=netobserv make deploy deploy-loki deploy-grafana
```

It will deploy the operator in its latest version, with port-forwarded Loki and Grafana (they are optional).

> Note: the `loki-deploy` script is provided as a quick install path and is not suitable for production. It deploys a single pod, configures a 10GB storage PVC, with 24 hours of retention. For a scalable deployment, please refer to [our distributed Loki guide](https://github.com/netobserv/documents/blob/main/loki_distributed.md) or [Grafana's official documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/).

To deploy the monitoring pipeline, this `make` target installs a `FlowCollector` with default values:

```bash
make deploy-sample-cr
```

Alternatively, you can [grab and edit](./config/samples/flows_v1beta2_flowcollector.yaml) this config before installing it.

You can still edit the `FlowCollector` after it's installed: the operator will take care about reconciling everything with the updated configuration:

```bash
kubectl edit flowcollector cluster
```

Refer to the [Configuration section](#configuration) of this document.

### With or without Loki?

Historically, Grafana Loki was a strict dependency but it isn't anymore. If you don't want to install it, you can still get the Prometheus metrics, and/or export raw flows to a custom collector. But be aware that some of the Console plugin features will be disabled. For instance, you will not be able to view raw flows there, and the metrics / topology will have a more limited level of details, missing information such as pods or IPs.

### OpenShift Console

_Pre-requisite: OpenShift 4.10 or above_

If the OpenShift Console is detected in the cluster, a console plugin is deployed when a `FlowCollector` is installed. It adds new pages and tabs to the console:

#### Overview metrics

Charts on this page show overall, aggregated metrics on the cluster network. The stats can be refined with comprehensive filtering and display options. Different levels of aggregations are available: per zone, per node, per namespace, per owner or per pod/service. For instance, it allows to identify biggest talkers in different contexts: top X inter-namespace flows, or top X pod-to-pod flows within a namespace, etc.

The watched time interval can be adjusted, as well as the refresh frequency, hence you can get an almost live view on the cluster traffic. This also applies to the other pages described below.

![Overview](./docs/assets/overview-dashboard.png)

#### Topology

The topology view represents traffic between elements as a graph. The same filtering and aggregation options as described above are available, plus extra display options e.g. to group element by node, namespaces, etc. A side panel provides contextual information and metrics related to the selected element.

![Topology](./docs/assets/topology-main.png)
_This screenshot shows the NetObserv architecture itself: Nodes (via eBPF agents) sending traffic (flows) to the collector flowlogs-pipeline, which in turn sends data to Loki. The NetObserv console plugin fetches these flows from Loki._

#### Flow table

The table view shows raw flows, ie. non aggregated, still with the same filtering options, and configurable columns.

![Flow table](./docs/assets/network-traffic-main.png)

#### Integration with existing console views

These views are accessible directly from the main menu, and also as contextual tabs for any Pod, Deployment, Service (etc.) in their details page, with filters set to focus on that particular resource.

## Configuration

The `FlowCollector` resource is used to configure the operator and its managed components. A comprehensive documentation is [available here](./docs/FlowCollector.md), and a full sample file [there](./config/samples/flows_v1beta2_flowcollector.yaml).

To edit configuration in cluster, run:

```bash
kubectl edit flowcollector cluster
```

As it operates cluster-wide on every node, only a single `FlowCollector` is allowed, and it has to be named `cluster`.

A couple of settings deserve special attention:

- Agent features (`spec.agent.ebpf.features`) can enable more features such as tracking packet drops, TCP latency (RTT) and DNS requests and responses.

- Sampling `spec.agent.ebpf.sampling`: a value of `100` means: one flow every 100 is sampled. `1` means all flows are sampled. The lower it is, the more flows you get, and the more accurate are derived metrics, but the higher amount of resources are consumed. By default, sampling is set to 50 (ie. 1:50). Note that more sampled flows also means more storage needed. We recommend to start with default values and refine empirically, to figure out which setting your cluster can manage.

- Loki (`spec.loki`): configure here how to reach Loki. The default URL values match the Loki quick install paths mentioned in the _Getting Started_ section, but you may have to configure differently if you used another installation method. You will find more information in our guides for deploying Loki: [with Loki Operator](https://github.com/netobserv/documents/blob/main/loki_operator.md), or an alternative ["distributed Loki" guide](https://github.com/netobserv/documents/blob/main/loki_distributed.md). You should set `spec.loki.mode` according to the chosen installation method, for instance use `LokiStack` if you use the Loki Operator. Make sure to disable Loki (`spec.loki.enable`) if you don't want to use it.

- Quick filters (`spec.consolePlugin.quickFilters`): configure preset filters to be displayed in the Console plugin. They offer a way to quickly switch from filters to others, such as showing / hiding pods network, or infrastructure network, or application network, etc. They can be tuned to reflect the different workloads running on your cluster. For a list of available filters, [check this page](./docs/QuickFilters.md).

- Kafka (`spec.deploymentModel: Kafka` and `spec.kafka`): when enabled, integrates the flow collection pipeline with Kafka, by splitting ingestion from transformation (kube enrichment, derived metrics, ...). Kafka can provide better scalability, resiliency and high availability. It's also an option to consider when you have a bursty traffic. [This page](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-apache-kafka) provides some guidance on why to use Kafka. When configured to use Kafka, NetObserv operator assumes it is already deployed and a topic is created. For convenience, we provide a quick deployment using [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io/): run `make deploy-kafka` from the repository.

- Exporters (`spec.exporters`) an optional list of exporters to which to send enriched flows. Currently, KAFKA and IPFIX are available (only KAFKA being actively maintained). This allows you to define any custom storage or processing that can read from Kafka or from an IPFIX collector.

- To enable availability zones awareness, set `spec.processor.addZone` to `true`.

### Metrics

More information on Prometheus metrics is available in a dedicated page: [Metrics.md](./docs/Metrics.md).

### Performance fine-tuning

In addition to sampling and using Kafka or not, other settings can help you get an optimal setup without compromising on the observability.

Here is what you should pay attention to:

- Resource requirements and limits (`spec.agent.ebpf.resources`, `spec.agent.processor.resources`): adapt the resource requirements and limits to the load and memory usage you expect on your cluster. The default limits (800MB) should be sufficient for most medium sized clusters. You can read more about reqs and limits [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

- eBPF agent's cache max flows (`spec.agent.ebpf.cacheMaxFlows`) and timeout (`spec.agent.ebpf.cacheActiveTimeout`) control how often flows are reported by the agents. The higher are `cacheMaxFlows` and `cacheActiveTimeout`, the less traffic will be generated by the agents themselves, which also ties with less CPU load. But on the flip side, it leads to a slightly higher memory consumption, and might generate more latency in the flow collection. There is [a blog entry](https://github.com/netobserv/documents/blob/main/blogs/agent_metrics_perf/index.md) dedicated to this fine-tuning.

- It is possible to reduce the overall observed traffic by restricting or excluding interfaces via `spec.agent.ebpf.interfaces` and `spec.agent.ebpf.excludeInterfaces`. Note that the interface names may vary according to the CNI used.

- Each component offers more advanced settings via `spec.agent.ebpf.advanced`, `spec.processor.advanced`, `spec.loki.advanced` and `spec.consolePlugin.advanced`. The agent has [environment variables](https://github.com/netobserv/netobserv-ebpf-agent/blob/main/docs/config.md) that you can set through `spec.agent.ebpf.advanced.env`.

#### Loki

The `FlowCollector` resource includes configuration of the Loki client, which is used by the processor (`flowlogs-pipeline`) to connect and send data to Loki for storage. They impact two things: batches and retries.

- `spec.loki.writeBatchWait` and `spec.loki.writeBatchSize` control the batching mechanism, ie. how often data is flushed out to Loki. Like in the eBPF agent batching, higher values will generate fewer traffic and consume less CPU, however it will increase a bit the memory consumption of `flowlogs-pipeline`, and may increase a bit collection latency.

- `spec.loki.advanced.writeMinBackoff`, `spec.loki.writeMaxBackoff` and `spec.loki.writeMaxRetries` control the retry mechanism. Retries may happen when Loki is unreachable or when it returns errors. Often, it is due to the rate limits configured on Loki server. When such situation occurs, it might not always be the best solution to increase rate limits (on server configuration side) or to increase retries. Increasing rate limits will put more pressure on Loki, so expect more memory and CPU usage, and also more traffic. Increasing retries will put more pressure on `flowlogs-pipeline`, as it will retain data for longer and accumulate more flows to send. When all the retry attempts fail, flows are simply dropped. Flow drops are counted in the metric `netobserv_loki_dropped_entries_total`.

On the Loki server side, configuration differs depending on how Loki was installed, e.g. via Helm chart, Loki Operator, etc. Nevertheless, here are a couple of settings that may impact the flow processing pipeline:

- Rate limits ([cf Loki documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configuration/#limits_config)), especially ingestion rate limit, ingestion burst size, per-stream rate limit and burst size. When these rate limits are reached, Loki returns an error when `flowlogs-pipeline` tries to send batches, visible in logs. A good practice is to define an alert, to get notified when these limits are reached: [cf this example](https://github.com/netobserv/documents/blob/main/examples/distributed-loki/alerting/loki-ratelimit-alert.yaml). It uses a metrics provided by the Loki operator: `loki_request_duration_seconds_count`. In case you don't use the Loki operator, you can replace it by the same metric provided by NetObserv Loki client, named `netobserv_loki_request_duration_seconds_count`.

- Max active streams / max streams per user: this limit is reached when too many streams are created. In Loki terminology, a stream is a given set of labels (keys and values) used for indexing. NetObserv defines labels for source and destination namespaces and pod owners (ie. aggregated workloads, such as Deployments). So the more workloads are running and generating traffic on the cluster, the more chances there are to hit this limit, when it's set. We recommend setting a high limit or turning it off (0 stands for unlimited).

#### With Kafka

More performance fine-tuning is possible when using Kafka, ie. with `spec.deploymentModel` set to `Kafka`:

- You can set the size of the batches (in bytes) sent by the eBPF agent to Kafka, with `spec.agent.ebpf.kafkaBatchSize`. It has a similar impact than `cacheMaxFlows` mentioned above, with higher values generating less traffic and less CPU usage, but more memory consumption and more latency. We expect the default values to be a good fit for most environments.

- If you find that the Kafka consumer might be a bottleneck, you can increase the number of replicas with `spec.processor.kafkaConsumerReplicas`, or set up an horizontal autoscaler with `spec.processor.kafkaConsumerAutoscaler`.

- Other advanced settings for Kafka include `spec.processor.kafkaConsumerQueueCapacity`, that defines the capacity of the internal message queue used in the Kafka consumer client, and `spec.processor.kafkaConsumerBatchSize`, which indicates to the broker the maximum batch size, in bytes, that the consumer will read.


### Securing data and communications

#### Authorizations

NetObserv is meant to be used by cluster admins, or, when using the Loki Operator (v5.7 or above), project admins (ie. users having admin permissions on some namespaces only). Multi-tenancy is based on namespaces permissions, with allowed users able to get flows limited to their namespaces. Flows across two namespaces will be visible to them as long as they have access to at least one of these namespaces.

Since `FlowCollector v1beta2`, NetObserv is automatically configured with multi-tenancy enabled when `spec.loki.mode` is `LokiStack`.

To give flow logs access to a `test` user, run:

```bash
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user netobserv-reader test
```

More information about multi-tenancy can be found on [this page](https://github.com/netobserv/documents/blob/main/loki_operator.md#netobserv-configuration).

Note that multi-tenancy is not possible without using the Loki Operator.

#### Network Policy

For a production deployment, it is also highly recommended to lock down the `netobserv` namespace (or wherever NetObserv is installed) using network policies.
An example of network policy is [provided here](https://github.com/netobserv/documents/blob/main/examples/lockdown-netobserv.yaml).

#### Communications

By default, communications between internal components are not secured. Note that, when using the Loki Operator, securing communication with TLS is necessary. There are several places where TLS can be set up:

- Connections to Loki (from the processor `flowlogs-pipeline` and from the Console plugin), by setting `spec.loki.tls`.
- With Kafka (both on producer and consumer sides), by setting `spec.kafka.tls`. Mutual TLS is supported here.
- The metrics server running in the processor (`flowlogs-pipeline`) can listen using TLS, via `spec.processor.metrics.server.tls`.
- The Console plugin server always uses TLS.
